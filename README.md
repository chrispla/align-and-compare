## Utilizing Hierarchical Structure for Audio-Based Music Similarity
Code for the Late-Breaking Demo on ISMIR 2021 | [Paper](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2021/latebreaking/000057.pdf), [Poster](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/production-main-contentbucket52d4b12c-1x4mwd6yn8qjn/1c8eb7df-d463-4bc5-b33e-ac615490788c.pdf), [Video](https://youtu.be/0yJkVQqi67U)



### Instructions

The code was tested with Python 3.8, but 3.7 and above should work. The dependecies to run it are:

* numpy
* scipy
* librosa
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* your prefered way to run jupyter notebooks

For simplicity, I decided to add everything to the `align-and-compare.ipynb` notebook, so you can follow every step linearly.



### Notes

This is an ongoing work, and more things will be and have been developed since the submition of the paper. This repository is meant for the demonstration of the concepts mentioned in the paper above. Please feel free to reach out to me about any aspects of this project.
